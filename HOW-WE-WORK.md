# **How we work**

Welcome to our community of Ariz GMS contributors! Our main goal is to provide a simplified platform that addresses the following issues within human aid operations; Localization, transfer of funds beyond borders, and corruption.
This document provides an overview of how we collaborate using lightweight and mostly asynchronous processes.
We welcome all kinds of competencies in our community. Humanitarian professionals, developers, 

# **How to contribute**

**- Report issues/request a feature:** To report a bug or a feature request, please review all open and closed issues to ensure no one has previously created a similar topic. Create a new Issue/feature and place it with status 0. Please use our Issue/feature template.

**- Contribute code:** Review the list of good first issues. You can pick any issues from the Backlog column and indicate your interest by leaving comments. 

**- Triage issues:** You are welcome to help us triage by verifying or reproducing bugs, adding more specific reproduction instructions, or voting on issues by adding a thumbs-up reaction to the issue's description comment.

# **Agreement**

As contributors, we believe we can all succeed when we embrace these principles:

* Ownership & Code Quality: Take full ownership of assigned issues, delivering high-quality work. Adhere to our workflow and limit work-in-progress to two issues at a time.

* Participation & Support: Participate daily by promptly responding to requests and supporting fellow contributors.

* Visibility & Organization: Maintain visibility on your progress by keeping tickets up to date. Additionally, contribute to triaging tickets to maintain an organized backlog.

* Code Review: Code owners should commit to reviewing tickets at least twice a week for approximately one hour. This enables progress and unlocks others.

* Risk Identification & Management: Surface and address risks or blockers promptly, working collaboratively to minimize their impact.

* Problem-Solving: Go beyond the acceptance criteria to understand and effectively address the underlying problem.

# **Project management**

To keep track of our progress and manage issues in an efficient way we use a [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/arizas/projects/7/views/1) The board consists of the following columns.

**0. No status** Suggestions

**1. Triage:** Issues that are approved and need processing, such as adding details, priority, and size.

**2. Backlog:** Issues that are accepted and ready for development.

**3. In Development:** Issues that are in active development.

**4. Blockers:** Issues that are blocked.

**5. In Review:** Issues that are waiting for peer review.

**6. Done:** Items that are shipped to production.

**7. Closed:** Items that we won’t fix or can’t reproduce.

# **Triaging**
Triaging is the process of reviewing all new issues to ensure they are ready for development. Here's how we do it:

**1. Validation:** Ariz GMS contributors may review new issues in the triage column and determine if they are valid, actionable, and useful. We may update the title or description, verify the reproduction steps, remove duplicates, and apply the appropriate labels.

**2. Prioritization:** Ariz GMS Moderators will work to prioritize issues using these levels:

P0: Critical issues that need immediate attention.

P1: High-priority issues to address next.

P2: Medium-priority issues to address in the coming weeks.

P3: Low-priority issues to address in the future.

**3. Sizing:** Ariz GMS contributors may estimate the level of effort using t-shirt sizes:

XS: 1/2 day

S: 1 day

M: 3 days

L: 1 Week

XL: 2 Weeks

XXL: 2+ Weeks

Please add questions or comments for any clarifications or design needs to help with estimation.

**4. Milestones:** Ariz GMS will group several related tickets into themes using milestones.

**5. Start/End Dates:** Active Ariz GMS contributors may assign estimated dates to help us plan the roadmap and potential resource needs for specific deliverables. Please ensure that end date and size is updated when accepting an Issue.

# **Communication**
We use the following channels for communication:
1. GitHub discussions
2. Twitter @HelloAriz
