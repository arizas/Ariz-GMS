# **Agreements**

As contributors, we believe we can all succeed when we embrace these principles:

Ownership & Code Quality: Take full ownership of assigned issues, delivering high-quality code. Adhere to our developer workflow and limit work-in-progress to two issues at a time.

Participation & Support: Participate daily by promptly responding to requests and supporting fellow contributors.

Visibility & Organization: Maintain visibility on your progress by keeping tickets up to date. Additionally, contribute to triaging tickets to maintain an organized backlog.

Code Review: Code owners should commit to reviewing tickets at least twice a week for approximately one hour. This enables progress and unlocks others.

Risk Identification & Management: Surface and address risks or blockers promptly, working collaboratively to minimize their impact.

* Problem-Solving: Go beyond the acceptance criteria to understand and effectively address the underlying problem.
